Example containers for developing in Rust language.

Configuration files for Vagga containers.

Status:  work in progress, I'm just learning it myself.  I expose almost everything I work on in Git, much of it is experimental.

Two example containers:
- one for compiling to the target host in the container
- one for cross-compiling to a different target than the host of the container (e.g. embedded ARM) using Xargo

Use these to quickly get started programming in Rust.  (Alternative: use the Rust playground.)

Quick start:
- install Vagga
- clone this repository
- open a terminal
- >cd to one of the example directories
- >vagga run
- expect "Hello world" or LED to blink (embedded.)
