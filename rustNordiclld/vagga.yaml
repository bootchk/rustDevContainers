# vagga configuration for a cross rust dev environment
# The container will compile rust for a target other than the container's host.
# E.g. target is embedded computer having such as ARM ISA

# Using a chain of containers.
# Checkpoints containers so they don't rebuild when one fails to install
# Each more  specific than its parent
# In the order of likelihood to fail (most stable containers first.)


containers:

  # basic container having C language tools
  
  base:
  
    setup:
    - !Ubuntu artful
    # xenial
    
    # !!! Add repositories/ppa's for some "interesting" packages such as gcc-arm-none-eabi
    # - !UbuntuUniverse

    # C compiler and other tools
    # overkill? but still doesn't install curl?
    - !Install [build-essential, ca-certificates]

    # Subsequent containers (rustup) need curl
    - !Install [curl]
    
    # Subsequent containers optionally use git
    - !Install [git]
    
    # Subsequent containers use llvm's lld linker
    # For xenial, only 4.0 available.  5.0 available in artful (still in dev)
    # !!! executable name is ld.lld-4.0
    # 5.0 is needed to support MEMORY command in scripts
    - !Install [lld-5.0]




  
  
  # container having rustup
  # rustup is toolchain mulitplexer (nightly and other versions of rust tools).
  # cargo will not install rustup; rustup installs cargo.
  
  # An alternative is to install a single version of rust from a binary distribution.
  
  # Rustup installation installs not only rustup, but a (first) version of rust tools.
  # Default to version: nightly (i.e. unstable).
  
  # We choose nightly because cross compiling requires it (as of this writing.)
